How can we better manage the symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD) together? <br /><br />

You can help us understand the fluctuations of PD symptoms and ultimately improve the quality of life for people with PD. Whether you have PD, are touched by someone who has or has had PD, or you want to help, we would love for you to participate in this study.<br/><br/> 

We at Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) want to understand why some people with PD have different symptoms than other people with PD, why a person's symptoms and side effects can vary over time and what can be done to help manage these symptoms day to day. <br /><br />

Through surveys and phone sensor data, we can collect and track health and PD symptoms like dexterity, balance, and gait. By participating in this study you will help us learn the range of PD symptoms and find out whether mobile devices can help measure PD progression and manage these symptoms better.  In this unique study, you will be a research partner. <br /><br />

If you are over 18 years old we invite you to join the study and make a difference in the lives of people affected by PD.</p>
